### Summary

Open the MAI bridge from Kava EVM to destination chain(s).

### Abstract

Allow bridging of MAI from Kava EVM to one or more suitable chains for collateralization.

### Motivation

Deploying on Kava EVM didn't not bring any revenue to QiDao and the collaboration with Equilibre came to an end. A new MAI bridge was being prepared as the final step of ending operations on Kava. Unfortunately the opening day coincided with the Multichain collapse, and it remained closed. As a part of MAI the recovery process I propose opening the bridge to bring MAI home for collateralization.
